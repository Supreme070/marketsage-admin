  - `IT_ADMIN` - Technical administration and system management
  - `ADMIN` - Business operations and user management

- ‚ùå **BLOCKED ROLES**:
  - `USER` - Regular customer users
  - `AI_AGENT` - Automated system agents

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

### Backend Protection

#### AdminPortalGuard
Location: `/Users/supreme/Desktop/marketsage-backend/src/auth/guards/admin-portal.guard.ts`

This guard enforces:
1. User must be authenticated (JWT token)
2. Email must end with `@marketsage.africa`
3. Role must be `SUPER_ADMIN`, `IT_ADMIN`, or `ADMIN`

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
@Controller('admin')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, AdminPortalGuard)
export class AdminController {
  // All routes in this controller are protected
}
```

#### Authentication Flow
1. User attempts to login via `/api/v2/auth/login`
2. Backend validates credentials
3. Backend checks if user is suspended (`isSuspended` flag)
4. Backend validates email domain and role
5. JWT token generated if all checks pass
6. Frontend stores token in localStorage
7. All API requests include JWT in Authorization header
8. AdminPortalGuard validates each protected request

## üë• Authorized Staff Accounts

### Current Staff Members

| Email | Role | Organization | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| admin@marketsage.africa | SUPER_ADMIN | MarketSage Internal | Active |
| supreme@marketsage.africa | SUPER_ADMIN | MarketSage Internal | Active |
| anita@marketsage.africa | ADMIN | MarketSage Internal | Active |
| kola@marketsage.africa | IT_ADMIN | MarketSage Internal | Active |

### Creating New Admin Users

**IMPORTANT**: Use the dedicated admin creation script:

```bash
cd /Users/supreme/Desktop/marketsage-backend
npm run create-admin
```

This script:
- Creates "MarketSage Internal" organization (if not exists)
- Creates user with specified admin role
- Enforces @marketsage.africa email domain
- Sets proper organizationId

**DO NOT** use the regular registration endpoint for admin users.

- Payload includes: userId, email, role, organizationId
- Stored in localStorage (frontend)

### 3. Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must include: uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- Hashed using bcrypt (10 rounds)

### 4. Account Lockout
- Failed login attempts tracked
- Lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Lockout duration: Configurable (default: 15 minutes)

## üìã Compliance & Best Practices

### Data Protection
- All API communications over HTTPS (production)
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- JWT tokens transmitted securely
- No sensitive data in logs

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular access reviews
- Immediate revocation for departing staff

### Monitoring
- Real-time access monitoring
- Anomaly detection (planned)
- Security alerts (planned)
- Regular security audits
